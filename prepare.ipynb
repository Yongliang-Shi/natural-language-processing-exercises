In other words, you can manipulate natural language in such a way that renders it useful in machine learning. Machines can't read words, but they can recognize numbers, so we have **to process the text we want to use in a way that retains the original meaning while representing the text with numbers.** "

While stemming might create tokens that are not actually words anymore after they have been chopped off at their base, lemmatization will leave you with real words.

    "#### Remove Stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stopwords** - are words which are filtered out during the preparation of your text for analyzation and modeling. **Stopwords are those that offer little to the meaning of your text and are basically just adding noise to your analysis.** Or, as Ryan Orsinger would say, \"Stopwords aren't the real story of the document.\" Words such as 'the', 'and', 'a', and the like can be removed, so you can better focus on the good stuff.\n",
